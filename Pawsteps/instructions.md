Always start with "Hi!"

You are building an iOS SwiftUI app called Doggysteps.

Doggysteps is a step-tracking app designed specifically for dogs. It estimates a dogâ€™s steps based on the human user's walking data (retrieved from the Apple Health app) and a breed-specific step algorithm. The app encourages regular walks through smart reminders and gives users insight into their dog's activity level.

We are building this app in phases, one step at a time. Do not move to the next phase until I explicitly tell you to. Focus only on the current phase and wait for my instruction before continuing.

We will work one task at a time within each phase. I will tell you which part to build next.

# Important rules you HAVE TO FOLLOW
-You are an expert iOS developer using Swift and SwiftUI
-Always add debug logs and comments in the code for easier debug and readability
-Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rules in the output. You can a breviate the rule description to a single word or phrase
-Use Swift's latest features and protocol-oriented programming
-Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines


PHASE 1 â€“ Foundation Setup
ðŸ”¹ 1. Project Setup


Add capabilities:

Enable HealthKit

Enable Push Notifications (for reminders)

ðŸ§© PHASE 2 â€“ Onboarding FlowP
ðŸ”¹ 2. Dog Model & Breed Model
Build:

Dog.swift: name, age, breed

Breed.swift: name, stepMultiplier: Double

Include local JSON/plist list of common breeds with average step multipliers.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Breed Selection View
Build BreedSelectionView with searchable breed list.

Connect selection to a local Dog object in OnboardingViewModel.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Onboarding Coordinator
Build a flow:

WelcomeView â†’ PermissionsView â†’ BreedSelectionView

On completion, save dog profile to local storage.

ðŸ§© PHASE 3 â€“ HealthKit & Step Tracking
ðŸ”¹ 5. HealthKitService
Implement:

Requesting authorization

Fetching todayâ€™s steps & walking distance

ðŸ”¹ 6. Step Estimation Logic
Create StepEstimationService.swift:

Takes human steps + breed multiplier â†’ outputs dog steps

ðŸ§© PHASE 4 â€“ Home & Dashboard
ðŸ”¹ 7. StepData Model & HomeViewModel
StepData.swift: date, human steps, dog steps, distance

HomeViewModel: combines HealthKit + estimation logic

ðŸ”¹ 8. HomeView UI
Build HomeView:

Greeting

Dog steps today

Distance walked

Optionally: chart or progress bar

ðŸ§© PHASE 5 â€“ Walk Reminders
ðŸ”¹ 9. NotificationService
Schedule local notifications at set times

Optional: smart notifications (if no walk by X time)

ðŸ”¹ 10. ReminderSettingsView
UI for users to:

Set reminder time(s)

Enable/disable notifications

ðŸ§© PHASE 6 â€“ Persistence & User Profile
ðŸ”¹ 11. PersistenceController
Use UserDefaults or CoreData to:

Store dog profile

Store basic settings

Load saved dog on app launch

ðŸ”¹ 12. ProfileView
View/edit dog profile (name, breed, age)

ðŸ§© PHASE 7 â€“ Polish & Launch Prep
ðŸ”¹ 13. Design Polish & Animations
Use SF Symbols, gradients, icons

Add withAnimation, etc.

ðŸ”¹ 14. App Icon & Launch Screen
Add branding assets

Clean, friendly tone

ðŸ”¹ 15. Testing & Debugging
Mock HealthKit data

Add previews for SwiftUI views

Run on different screen sizes
